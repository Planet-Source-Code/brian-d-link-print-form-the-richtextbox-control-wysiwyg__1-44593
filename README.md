## \[ Print form the Richtextbox control WYSIWYG \]


</div>

### Description

I seen that every code can't do it right when printing from the richTextBox Control it seems to print out source code, Well, I found what you need! I did not write this code I was researching on how to do this. As soon as I found it and seen it work, I uploaded it here on PSC. It will print WYSIWYG(What you see is what you get) What ever is in the richtext control is how it will print. Now I can move on and finish my other program needing this code :-) I hope this helps you!
